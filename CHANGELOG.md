# Changelog

All notable public-release changes are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Strip private registry, Apollo, and k3s preview hosts; default sandbox images
  to `universal-sandbox-*:local` (keep public `github.com/cocofhu` / `ghcr.io/cocofhu`).
- Rename the product to Approving (MIT, Copyright 2026 cocofhu) and publish
  preparation for github.com/cocofhu/approving.
- Adopt `APPROVING_*` environment variables, `.approving/` workspace paths, and
  matching binary/image names.
- Remove repository GitLab CI, VitePress docs site, showcases, deploy previews,
  and root selftest scripts. Keep sandbox Git host authorization for GitLab and
  GitHub (`GITLAB_*` / `GITHUB_*` / SSH on Agent meta env).
- Vendor `sandbox-gateway` (control plane + universal sandbox image) into
  `sandbox-gateway/` so a single clone runs via `./start.sh` / `docker compose up`.
- Add GitHub Actions CI, release-smoke, and GHCR publish workflows; root
  community policy files; `GATEWAY.md` and generated `server/CONFIGURATION.md`.
